# DynamicCalculator

## In development

I see many type of calculation app and they don't do many of the things i want
* solve for missing variable. 
* show equation
* Allow me to choice proper unites
* Equations built of equations
* Look nice

So what i'm working on is to have a json object that you can put all your formulas into and it will create a beatiful calculator app.  


I'm using MathML for the formulas. 

I'm using Algebra.js for solving for variables.
